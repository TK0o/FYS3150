which can be in any order.
for the code to register an individual run the word
simulate has to be used, followed by the parameters and their values.
the values has to be given after an equal "=" sign.

if no value has been givien then the code falls back on predetermined 
or default values, which is the values given in problem 7.

note, the file_name = "specific name" must include the filetype or extention, 
meaning it must end in a valid file format such as .txt as an example. it is
worth mentioning that it will create an output file in the /data folder
even if there isn't any given file name in this file. in case of no given file
name it will fall back on predetermined filenames for the output files.

several instances of "simulate" can be used at the same time, and the code 
interprets it as seperate simulations to run in succession. 

it is possible to add comments to the output files, which follows the same
syntax as in c++, meaning everything after a "//" will be interpreted as add
comment, same as everything inside "/**/" even over multiple lines.

the amount of slits can be set to more than 3, as it can be set to any number
as long as it fits inside the boundary. note that slit_size_y and slit_dist_y
would have to be adjusted accordingly to the amount of slits that is given 
in this input file.

note that the use of multiple simulations from this file currently gives
a "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" error.
